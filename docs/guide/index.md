# Introduction
[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) is a extensible static site generator launched by Vue.js, It was created to support the documentation needs of Vue's own sub projects.

And [Vuepress v2](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/)(vuepress@next) is released, the Vuepress2 is more convenient. It use Vite to be the builder and base on Vue 3 all by default, from v1 to v2 is a big change.

Everything is beautiful, but some problem comes with Vuepress 2's release, that is the official blog plugin not support for it. Although the plugin author mark a `feature` lable for this and 1 year passed, but I really need it to run on **vuepress@next** and I can't wait ... hah hah.

So I wrote this simple-blog plugin for vuepress, [let's see how to use it!](/guide/getting-started/)
